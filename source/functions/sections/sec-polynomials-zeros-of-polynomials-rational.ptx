        The functions described in this section frequently occur as mathematical models of 
        real-life situations. For instance, in business the demand function gives the
        price per item, <m>p</m>, in terms of the number of items sold, <m>x</m>.
        Suppose a company finds that the price <m>p</m> (in Birr) for its model GC-5 calculator
        is related to the number of calculators sold, <m>x</m> (in millions), and is given by
        the demand function <m>p = 80 - x^{2}</m>.
    </p>

    <p> 
        The manufacturerâ€™s revenue is determined by multiplying the number of items sold
        (<m>x</m>) by the price per item (<m>p</m>). Thus, the revenue function is
        <me>\boxed{R = xp = x(80 - x^2) = 80x - x^3}</me>
    </p>

    <p>
        These demand and revenue functions are examples of polynomial functions. 
        The major aim of this section is to better understand the significance of
        applied functions (such as this demand function).In order to do this, 
        we need to analyze the domain, range, and behavior of such functions.

                A polynomial function is a function of the form
                <m>y(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_{1}x+a_{0},a^{3}\neq 0</m>

                        The graph of a polynomial is a smooth unbroken curve. The word smooth means that the

        <title>Zeros of a polynomial</title>
        <p>
            The zeros of a polynomial function provide valuable information that can be
            helpful in sketching its graph. One can find the zeros by factorizing the polynomial. 
            However, we have no general method for factorizing polynomials of degree
            greater than <m>2</m>. In this subsection, we turn our attention to methods that
            will allow us to find zeros of higher degree polynomials. To do this, 
            we first need to discuss about the division algorithm. 
            Recall that a number <m>a</m> is a zero of a polynomial function <m>p</m> if 
            <m>p(a) = 0</m>.

                <m>q(x)</m> and <m>R(x)</m> such that

            With the aid of the division algorithm, we can derive two important theorems that will allow us to
            recognize the zeros of polynomials.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we apply the division algorithm where the divisor, <m>d(x)</m>, is linear
            (that is of the form <m>x - r</m>), we get
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>\boxed{p(x)=(x-r)q(x)+R}</me>
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that since the divisor is of the first degree, the remainder <m>R</m>, must be a constant. 
            If we now substitute <m>x = r</m>, into this equation, we get
        </p>
        <p>
            <me>P(r)=(r-r)q(r)+R = 0 \cdot q(r)+R</me>

            Therefore, <m>p(r) = R</m>.

            The Factor and Remainder theorems establish the intimate relationship between the factors of 
            a polynomial <m>p(x)</m> and its zeros. Recall that a polynomial of degree <m>n</m> 
            can have at most <m>n</m> zeros.  Does every polynomial have a zero? Our answer depends on
            the number system in which we are working. If we restrict ourselves to the set of real number system,
            then we are already familiar with the fact that the polynomial <m>p(x) = x^{2} + 1</m> has no real zeros.
            However, this polynomial does have two zeros in the complex number system.(The zeros are <m>i</m> and <m>- i</m>).
            Carl Friedrich Gauss (<m>1777-1855</m>), in his doctoral dissertation, proved that within the complex number system,
            every polynomial of degree <m>\geq 1</m> has at least one zero. This fact is usually referred to as the
            Fundamental theorem of Algebra.

            The theorems we have discussed so far are called existence theorems because they 
            ensure the existence of zeros and linear factors of polynomials. 
            These theorems do not tell us how to find the zeros or the linear factors. 
            The Linear Factorization Theorem guarantees that we can factor a polynomial of degree
            at least one into linear factors, but it does not tell us how.

            If we can get the quotient polynomial down to a quadratic, then we are able to determine all the roots. 
            But how do we find a root to start the process? The following theorem can be most helpful.

                    According to the Rational Root Theorem, if <m>\frac{p}{q}</m> is a rational root 
                    of the given equation, then <m>p</m> must be a factor of <m>-12</m> and <m>q</m> must be a factor of <m>2</m>.
                    Thus, we have

                <p>
                    We may check these possible roots by substituting the value in <m>p(x)</m>.
                    Now <m>p(1) = - 30</m> and <m>p( - 1) = 12</m>. 
                    Since <m>p(1)</m> is negative and <m>p( - 1)</m> is positive, by location theorem, <m>p(x)</m> 
                    has a zero between <m>- 1</m> and 1. Since <m>P\left( - \frac{1}{2} \right) = 0</m>, 
                    then <m>\left( x + \frac{1}{2} \right)</m> is a factor of <m>p(x)</m>. Using

                    the domain of <m>f</m>. Since <m>x^{2} - x - 12 = (x - 4)(x + 3)</m>, 
                    we have <m>\text{Dom}(f) = \left\{ x:x \neq - 3,4 \right\}</m>. To find the zeros of <m>f(x)</m>,

                    Consider where <m>a \geq 0</m> and <m>n</m> is a positive integer.

            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Obviously <m>a \in </m>Dom(<m>f</m>). 
                    Next, we investigate the trend of the values of <m>f(x)</m> near <m>a</m>. 
                    To do this, we consider two cases, when <m>n</m> is even or odd:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose <m>n</m> is even: In this case <m>(x-a)^n &gt; 0</m> for all
                    <m>x \in \mathbf{R}\{a\}</m>; and since  <m>(x-a)^n \rightarrow 0</m> as
                    <m>x \rightarrow a^+</m> or <m>x \rightarrow a^-</m>. 
                    Hence, as <m>x \rightarrow a^+</m> or <m>x \rightarrow a^-</m>. Therefore, 
                    <m>x=a</m> is a VA of <m>f(x)</m>. Moreover, <m>y=\frac{1}{a^n}</m> or 
                    (<m>0,\frac{1}{a^n}</m>) is its y-intercept since <m>f(0) = \frac{1}{a^n}</m>.
                    However, it has no <m>x</m>-intercept since <m>f(x) &gt; 0</m> for all <m>x</m> in its domain 
                    (See, Fig. 2.2 (A)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose <m>n</m> is odd: In this case, <m>(x - a)^n &gt; 0</m> for all <m>x &gt; a</m>, and 
                    <m>\frac{1}{(x - a)^n} \rightarrow \infty</m> as <m>x \rightarrow a^+</m>, just like in the even case. 
                    Thus, <m>x = a</m> is a VA of <m>f(x)</m>. However, <m>\frac{1}{(x - a)^n} \rightarrow -\infty</m> as 
                    <m>x \rightarrow a^â€“</m>, since <m>(x - a)^n &lt; 0</m> for <m>x &lt; a</m>. 
                    Moreover, <m>y = \frac{-1}{a^n}</m> or <m>(0, \frac{-1}{a^n})</m> is its y-intercept, 
                    since <m>f(0) = \frac{-1}{a^n}</m>. However, it has no <m>x</m>-intercept in this case either. 
                    (See, Fig. 2.2 (B)).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that in both cases, <m>f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-a)^n} \rightarrow 0</m> as <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m>
                    or <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>.

                                                        remainder is <m>3</m>. Thus, <m>\frac{x+2}{x-1} = 1+ \frac{3}{x-1}</m>.
                                                        Thus, if <m>x \rightarrow \infty</m> (or <m>x \rightarrow -\infty</m>),
                                                        then <m>\frac{3}{x-1} \rightarrow 0</m> so that <m>f(x) \rightarrow 1</m>.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                        Hence, <m>y=1</m> is the HA of <m>f</m>.
                                                    </p>

                                            Using these information, you can sketch the graph of <m>f</m> as displayed 
                                            below in Fig. 2.3 (A). 
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                Both the denominator and numerator are <m>0</m> at <m>x=1</m>.
                                So, first factorize and simplify them: 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <m>x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x+2)(x+1)</m> and <m>x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)</m>. Therefore,
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <md>
                                    <mrow>g(x) = \frac{x^2 + 3x + 2}{x^2 - 1} \amp = \frac{(x+2)(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+1)}, x \neq -1 </mrow>
                                    <mrow> \amp = \frac{x+2}{x-1}. \qquad \qquad (\text{So,  dom}(g) = \Re \{ 1,-1\})</mrow>
                                </md>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This implies that only <m>x=1</m> is VA.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hence, the graph of <m>g(x) = \frac{x+2}{x-1}, x \neq -1</m>, 
                    is exactly the same as that of <m>f(x) = \frac{x+2}{x-1}</m> 
                    except that <m>g(x)</m> is not defined at <m>x= â€“1</m>. 
                    Therefore, the graph of <m>g</m> and its VA are the same as that of <m>f</m>
                    except that there should be a <q>hole</q> at the point corresponding to <m>x= â€“1</m> 
                    on the graph of <m>g</m> as shown on Fig. 2.3(B) below.
