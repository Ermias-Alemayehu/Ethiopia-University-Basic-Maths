    <title>The set of Integers</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            As the knowledge and interest of human beings increased, it was important and obligatory 
            to extend the natural number system. For instance to solve the equation <m>x+1= 0</m>, 
            the set of natural numbers was not sufficient. 
            Hence the set of integers was developed to satisfy such extended demands.

                    The set of integers is denoted by <alert>Z</alert> and described as 
                    <m>\mathbf{Z} = \left\{ \ldots , - 2, - 1, 0, 1 , 2, \ldots \right\}</m>

            <title>i) Addition <m>(+)</m></title>
            <p>
                If two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> are added using the operation <q><m>+</m></q>,
                then the sum <m>a+b</m> is also an integer. If the sum of the two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> 
                is denoted by <m>c</m>, then we can write the operation as: <m>c=a+b</m>,
                where <m>c</m> is called the sum and <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> are called terms.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>4+9 = 13</m>, here <m>13</m> is the sum whereas <m>4</m> &amp; <m>9</m> are terms.

            <title>ii) Subtraction <m>(-)</m></title>
            <p>
                For any two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, the operation of subtracting <m>b</m> from <m>a</m>, 
                denoted by <m>a - b</m> is defined by <m>a - b = a + ( - b)</m>. 
                This means that subtracting <m>b</m> from <m>a</m> is equivalent to adding the additive inverse of <m>b</m> to <m>a</m>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>

                If two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> are multiplied using the operation “<m>\times</m>”, 
                then the product <m>a</m><m>\times</m><m>b</m> is also an integer. 
                If the product of the two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> is denoted by <m>c</m>, 
                then we can write the operation as: <m>c = a \times b</m>, 
                where <m>c</m> is called the product and <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m> are called factors.

            <title>Properties of addition and multiplication on the set of integers</title>
            <p>
                i)  For any two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, the sum <m>a+b</m> is also an integer. 
                    For instance in the above example, <m>4</m> and <m>9</m> are integers, their sum <m>13</m> is also an integer. 
                    In general, we say that the set of integers is closed under addition.
            </p>
            <p>
                ii) For any two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, <m>a+b=b+a</m>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    <m> 4+9 = 9+4 = 13</m>. In general, we say that addition is commutative on the set of integers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                iii) For any three integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> &amp; <m>c</m>,<m>(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)</m>.
            </p>

                    <p>
                    <m> (5+9)+8 = 5+(9+8) = 22</m>. In general, we say that addition is associative on the set of integers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                iv) For any integer <m>a</m>, it holds that <m>a+0 = 0+a = a</m>.

                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>7+0 = 0+7 = 7</m>. In general, we say that addition has an identity element on the 
                        set of integers and <m>0</m> is the identity element.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                v) For any integer <m>a</m>, it holds that <m>a + ( - a) = - a + a = 0</m>.

                    <p>
                        <m>4+-4 = -4+4 = 0</m>. In general, we say that every integer <m>a</m> has an additive inverse denoted by<m>- a</m>.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                vi) For any two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, the product <m>a \times b</m> is also an integer. 
                    For instance in the above example, <m>4</m> and <m>7</m> are integers, their product <m>28</m> is also an integer. 
                    In general, we say that the set of integers is closed under multiplication.
            </p>
            <p>
                vii) For any two integers <m>a</m> &amp; <m>b</m>, <m>a \times b = b \times a</m>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>4 \times 7 = 7\times4 = 28</m>. In general, we say that multiplication is commutative on the set of integers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                viii) For any three integers <m>a</m>, <m>b</m> &amp; <m>c</m>, <m>(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)</m>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                    <m> (3 \times 5) \times 4 = 3 \times (5 \times 4) = 60 </m>. 
                    In general, we say that multiplication is associative on the set of integers.
                    </p>
                </statement>
            </example>
            <p>
                ix) For any integer <m>a</m>, it holds that <m>a \times 1 = 1 \times a = a</m>.
            </p>
            <example>
                <statement>
                    <p>
                        <m>5 \times 1 = 1 \times 5 = 5 </m>. In general, we say that multiplication has an 
                        identity element on the set of integers and <m>1</m> is the identity element.
                    </p>

                        In general, we say that multiplication is distributive over addition on the set of integers.
